# Acceleration
- Refers to how fast [[Velocity]] changes under a period of time.

Formula for Acceleration:
$$
acceleration(a)=
\frac
{Final\;Velocity (V_f)
-
Initial\;Velocity(V_i)}
{time(t)}
$$

## Big Note:
- When writing the ==final answer for acceleration, always remember== to put an exponent of two after the time.

Example:
$$
a = 500m\\/s ^2
$$
>*Is related to: [[Vector]], [[Velocity]]*
